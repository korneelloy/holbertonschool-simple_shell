.TH _SIMPLE SHELL

.SH NAME
_SIMPLE SHELL - a tool for printing data to the standard output

.SH SYNOPSIS
.B _printf
.RI (FORMAT, [ARGUMENT...])

.SH DESCRIPTION
The _printf function takes a first argument (FORMAT) and prints it, as such, to the standard output. 
.br

When a format specifier (recognisable with % sign) is encountered in this first argument, the format specifier
.br
will be exchanged with the next argument, in the ARGUMENT list.
.br

The _printf function returns the number of printed characters

.sp
The format specifiers are:
.br
%c will be replaced by the next argument in the argument list, which is expected to be a character
.br
%s will be replaced by the next argument in the argument list, which is expected to be a string
.br
%d will be replaced by the next argument in the argument list, which is expected to be an integer
.br
%i will be replaced by the next argument in the argument list, which is expected to be an integer base ten
.br
%b will be replaced by the next argument in the argument list, which is expected to be an integer base ten, in binary version
.br
%o will be replaced by the next argument in the argument list, which is expected to be an integer base ten, in octal version
.br
%u will be replaced by the next argument in the argument list, which is expected to be an integer base ten
.br
%x will be replaced by the next argument in the argument list, which is expected to be an integer base ten, in hexadecimal version, lowercase
.br
%X will be replaced by the next argument in the argument list, which is expected to be an integer base ten, in hexadecimal version, uppercase
.br
If a %% is encountered, a single % will be printed
.br
If the %-sign is followed by another character, the % and the character will be printed as normal characters


.sp

\\ is used as the escape character :
.br
If the escape character is used just in front of special characters such as \\, ", ' these characters lose their special meaning and will be printed as such.
.br
On the contrary, the escape character can also be used with some 'normal' letters to add some special behaviour:
.br
\\n will go to the next line
.br
\\a creates an alert with a beep sound
.br
\\b backspace
.br
\\f moves cursor to next page
.br
\\r moves cursor to beginning of the current line
.br
\\t tab
.br
\\v moves cursor to next vertical stop

.SH EXAMPLES
.TP
_printf("Test");
will print Test to the stdout

.TP
_printf("%s", "Test");
will do the same thing

.TP
char *name = "Joe";
.sp -1
.TP
_printf("My name is %s.", name);
will print My name is Joe. to the stdout

.TP
char age = 20;
.sp -1
.TP
_printf("I'm %d years old.", age);
will print I'm 20 years old. to the stdout


.SH EXIT STATUS
